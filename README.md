# C Philosophy
## There really isn't a philosophy
- This repo holds all my C ideas/experiments. 
- This contains:
	- Style ideas
	- Little tools
	- Code hacks (things you should never do but are fun to look at)
	- Implementation ideas (e.g pattern matching, objects,...)
		- making C do things I don't think everyone associates with it
