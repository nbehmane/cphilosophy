# Easy Input
## Motivation
- Had to create a getline wrapper for a previous project.
- Decided to write functions I can use in the future to do the work for me.
- Wanted to experiment with cprog\_classes idea from before.

## Usage *will be updated with more details*
- Run `gcc *.c *.h -o demo` *will be a Makefile eventually.*
- Run the demo.
- Read the driver code to see the usage. *this will be expanded later*

## Notes
- This isn't thread safe. *add an explanation later.*
